## 🎯What this project explores

How to simulate or analyze real-world sensor data from industrial machines.

Techniques for detecting patterns that precede mechanical failures.

Predictive models to forecast failures or estimate time-to-failure.

Dashboards and visualizations to support decision-making in operations or maintenance.

## 🧩 Why it matters

Industries often collect machine data but lack the resources to extract actionable insights. This project bridges that gap by showing how predictive maintenance can be implemented even with limited resources — offering valuable learnings for engineers, analysts, and operations teams alike.
